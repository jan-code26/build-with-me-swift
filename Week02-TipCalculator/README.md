# Week 02 – Tip Calculator 💰

This is the second project in my **"Build With Me: Swift Edition"** summer series.

## 📱 What It Does
A comprehensive tip calculator app with:
* Bill amount input with decimal pad keyboard
* Segmented picker for common tip percentages (10%, 15%, 20%)
* Custom tip percentage option with conditional text field
* Bill splitting functionality with increment/decrement buttons
* Real-time calculations displaying tip amount and total per person

## 🧠 What I Learned
* Managing multiple `@State` variables and their interactions
* Using `TextField` with `.number` format and `.decimalPad` keyboard type
* Implementing conditional UI with `if` statements in SwiftUI
* Creating computed properties for complex calculations
* Handling optional values with nil coalescing operator (`??`)
* Styling buttons with `.frame()`, `.background()`, and `.cornerRadius()`
* Using `Picker` with `.pickerStyle(SegmentedPickerStyle())`
* Defensive programming to prevent crashes from invalid input
