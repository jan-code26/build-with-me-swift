# Week 01 – Counter App 🧮

This is the first project in my **"Build With Me: Swift Edition"** summer series.

## 📱 What It Does
A simple SwiftUI app with:
- A counter display
- Increment and decrement buttons
- A reset button to bring the count back to 0

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Basics of `@State` for managing UI state
- Using `Text` and `Button` views in SwiftUI
- Applying modifiers like `.padding()`, `.cornerRadius()`, and `.background()`
- Formatting numbers using `.number` (thanks to [this blog](https://medium.com/@jpmtech/formatting-numbers-in-swiftui-fc5ee2920a59))
- How small layout tweaks change the look drastically
